          <!-- about section is just a paragraph about myself -->
          <p> I have an Associates degree in Software Development from College of Dupage and am currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp through <a href="http://www.thinkful.com">Thinkful.</a> I'm a team player, whenever I am assigned to a project with a group, I give it my all and take it very seriously. If everyone puts in their full effort, then groups can accomplish anything. I love gaming, and using the internet. They're what got me so interested in technology. I always admire the beauty of graphics, webpage layouts, HUDs, UIs, and animations.  </p>
